Project Description:
This program provides a library system to be controlled and used by the librarian/admin.
At first, the admin is asked to enter the required data for the books and users, for which the functions are called and objects are created for the specified data type.
Then the admin can perform a number of functions, 10 to be exact.
These functions allow the admin to add more data, or manipulate the data on hand.
The functions are:
Inserting more books.
Inserting more users.
Letting a user borrow a number of copies of a certain book.
Letting a user check in a number of copies of a certain book.
Searching for a certain book by its name and displaying its name, author, date of publishing, and number of available copies.
Searching for a certain author by name and displaying all the books with this author, their date of publishing, and their number of available copies.
Deleting a copy of book.
Searching for a user by the username and displaying the current borrowed books.
Deleting a user and moving all the borrowed books back to the library.
Exiting the program.

We were able to handle many of the cases which arose during runtime where there was invalid or logically unacceptable input.
